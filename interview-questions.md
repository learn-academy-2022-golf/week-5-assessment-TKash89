# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a class?

Your answer:
        When your calling super in a class, I believe that it takes the information from the parent class.

Researched answer:
        The super is used to call or refer to the parent class instance variable, accessing the data of the parent. This grants access to the parent's methods and properties. Super can also be used as a "function call", or a "property lookup".

2. What is a gem?


Your answer:
        To the best of my knowledge, a gem is found in Rspec, the testing tool used for the Ruby language. I'd be happy to find out more information and provide a more concrete and correct answer. 

Researched answer:
        Gems are pretty much open sourced libraries containing code for the Ruby language. RSpec is only one many Gems. RSpec is the ruby testing framework. There are others such as JSON, Rails, bundler, and Devise to name a few. 

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer:
        My best answer for what a relational database is would be a local database that you can access without searching else where.

Researched answer:
        This is a kind of database that houses and stores information which allows access to data points in relation to one another. These relationships are already pre-defined and organized for ease of access.      It seems like there are many other kinds of databases out there. To give a short list, there are: cloud data-b, End-user data-b, Graph data-b, and centralized data-b.

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer:
        Primary keys are found in the Ruby language, particularly in Ruby hashes.

Researched answer:
        I was mistaken explainig the primary keys have to do with the Ruby language. The correct answer is that primary keys have to do with databases, specifically the name of the column/columns that have values. These uniquely define each and every row in a table. Primary keys are important because of the speed and ease how data is called, is done using these keys.

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer:
        My memory is not the best recalling the HTTP verbs. I understand that CRUD stands for create/read/update/delete.

Researched answer:
        The HTTP verbs are as follows: post, get, put, patch, delete. These verbs correspond quite easily with CRUD. 
        Post = create
        get = create
        patch = update
        delete = delete


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes:
        These routes are designed to make clean and efficent routes that are able to be repeatedly used.

2. Ruby on Rails: 
        This is a full stack framework used to get ruby online and in a web application.

3. Database migrations:
        When data is being migrated to another open sourced database.

4. Params: 
        This is a shortened version of the word parameter, which act as storage in a function to pass data through.

5. ERB:
        Short for (Embedded RuBy), it allows language to be embedded in HTML. It also can include source code or plain text.
